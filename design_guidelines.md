# ByronAI Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from Apple's minimalist design patterns with modern glassmorphic and neon elements for a poetry-focused creative application.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Light Mode: Pure white (0 0% 100%) backgrounds, deep black (0 0% 8%) text
- Dark Mode: Rich black (0 0% 6%) backgrounds, pure white (0 0% 98%) text
- Neon Accent: Electric blue (220 100% 60%) for highlights and interactive elements
- Glass Effects: Semi-transparent overlays with subtle blue tints

### B. Typography
**Primary Font**: Inter or SF Pro Display (bold, rounded variants)
- Hero Headlines: Bold 700, 3-4rem, tight letter-spacing
- Section Headers: Bold 600, 2rem
- Body Text: Regular 400, 1rem with generous line-height (1.6)
- App Labels: Medium 500, 0.875rem

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Primitives**: Tailwind units of 4, 8, 16, and 24
- Consistent p-8 for section padding
- m-16 for major section spacing
- gap-4 for component spacing
- h-24 for navigation and key UI elements

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**: Minimal top navigation with glassmorphic background blur, centered logo, subtle border-bottom

**Hero Section**: Full-viewport height with bold typography, centered layout, gradient text effects on "ByronAI", subtle animated background particles

**Glassmorphic Cards**: 
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop-blur
- Subtle borders with neon blue accent
- Rounded corners (rounded-2xl)
- Soft drop shadows with blue tint

**Buttons**:
- Primary: Solid neon blue with rounded corners
- Secondary: Glass effect with blue border, blurred backgrounds when over images
- No custom hover states (leverage default button interactions)

**Feature Showcase**: Grid layout with glassmorphic cards containing app screenshots and feature descriptions

### E. Modern UI Elements
- Subtle gradient overlays on hero section
- Floating glassmorphic elements
- Minimal neon accent lines and borders
- Smooth transitions without distracting animations
- Clean iconography using Heroicons
- Breathing room with generous whitespace

## Images
**Hero Image**: Large background gradient or subtle geometric pattern, no photographic hero image
**App Screenshots**: Mobile mockups showcasing the poetry interface within glassmorphic cards
**Feature Icons**: Minimal line icons representing AI, writing, and creativity features
**Background Elements**: Subtle particle effects or geometric shapes with neon accents

## Key Sections
1. **Hero**: Bold ByronAI branding with value proposition
2. **Features**: 3-4 glassmorphic cards highlighting AI autocompletion
3. **App Preview**: Screenshots in elegant mobile frames
4. **Download**: Clean call-to-action with app store buttons

The design maintains Apple's principle of "simplicity is sophistication" while incorporating modern glassmorphic trends and strategic neon accents that reflect the creative, AI-powered nature of the poetry application.
